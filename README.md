- Drop into your .git/hooks folder
- Rename hook.sh to be whatever kind of hook you want
- Create a file called attask.conf with two variables: <code>ATTASK_USERNAME</code> and <code>ATTASK_PASSWORD</code>
- Change <code>https://hub.attask.com</code> in <code>attask-todo.js</code> to whatever AtTask server you want.
- Profit!
